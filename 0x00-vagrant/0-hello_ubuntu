uname Command
The uname tool is most commonly used to determine the processor architecture, the system hostname and the version of the kernel running on the system.

The syntax of the uname command takes the following form:

uname [OPTIONS]...
Copy
The options are as follows:

-s, (--kernel-name) - Prints the kernel name.
-n, (--nodename) - Prints the system’s node name (hostname). This is the name the system uses when communicating over the network. When used with the -n option, uname produces the same output as the hostname command.
-r, (--kernel-release) - Prints the kernel release.
-v, (--kernel-version) - Prints the kernel version.
-m, (--machine) - Prints the name of the machine’s hardware name.
-p, (--processor) - Prints the architecture of the processor.
-i, (--hardware-platform) - Prints the hardware platform.
-o, (--operating-system) - Print the name of the operating system. On Linux systems that is “GNU/Linux”
-a, (--all) - When the -a option is used, uname behaves the same as if the -snrvmo options have been given.
